# Ideas
- Make generic enough to work on a number of sports
- Must work for pickleball and tennis
- Define court by having user draw a rough outline of the lines, then in a manner simiar to magic wand in photoshop the program will automatically figure out the exact lines of the court
- Allow support for multiple datafeeds to create a more complete view of the court
